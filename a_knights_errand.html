	Yo.
          <br />
          <br />
Got a job for you — not my usual flavor, but I'm not one to turn down good Eddies. This one’s comin’ from one of them chrome crusaders over in Heywood. You know the White Knights? Full platemail, fake code of honor, real heavy BO? Yeah. Them. Gig's on behalf of a choom calling himself "Sir Taran Myr."
          <br />
          <br />
Couple of their couriers been runnin' quiet deliveries through the pipeways underground— seems some of 'em didn’t make it to the other side. No contact, no bodies. Now, Mr. Myr thinks the Steel Rats broke their peace deal & started snatching up bodies. Maybe he's right. Maybe not. I’m not in the business of guessing. That’s your department.
          <br />
          <br />
Job is simple:
          <br />
          <br />
	- Find out what happened to those runners.
          <br />
	- If the Rats are steppin’ outta line, bring bodies or receipts.
          <br />
	- Let me know what you find.
          <br />
          <br />
If someone in chainmail asks to parley, just smile & wave. 
          <br />
